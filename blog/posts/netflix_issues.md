# Problems with Netflix web and Netflix webos clients
I've had some issues with the Netflix service recently.


Here is my grievance list:

* The UI is too intrusive, starts preview of videos/shows when you are just browsing. Cannot turn this behaviour off.
Video plays from the start even though it clearly shows that the video is in mid viewing. Very annoying since I have to find the right position again.
* Items disappear from “My List” with no heads up warning. Very annoying. This is sometimes because Netflix remove shows from the platform which is also annoying and what’s more – they don’t clearly state what is going to go away and when inside the app. I have to go online and find out for myself.
* Things disappear from the “Continue watching as…” list with no heads up. Very annoying and forces me to maintain my own list of stuff I’m in the middle of watching. Sometimes this happens because a show is going off the platform (again, no heads up) and sometimes for no apparent reason at all.
* The UI does not allow me to store more than one list. I need one for things I’ve seen and for things I want to see as well as things I’m in the middle of seeing (see above why Netflix support for studd you are in the middle of watching is terrible).
* The site doesn’t provide an API for getting your data from Netflix. This may be a problem shared by a small minority of programming inclined users but it is important to me.

These problems are endemic to Netflix in general not just to a certain Netflix app or it’s website, so they cannot be solved at the application level. Netflix really needs to fix core issues to make progress on any of these issues.

As a result of all this I decided to leave Netflix. Bye bye.
