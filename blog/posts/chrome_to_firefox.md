# Move from Google-Chrome to Firefox on Linux

## The problems of Google-Chrome

There are several issues with Google-Chrome, some specific to Linux some not

* Google-Chrome is spying on you and sends way too much information to google and advertisers.
* Google-Chrome is using way too much CPU on Linux and it's responsiveness is much worse than that of Firefox. I've actually seen this in actual touch typing sites.
* Google-Chrome is writing too much and wears out your disk in Linux. This is a known issue https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/438456/google-chrome-high-i-o-writes

The result of all of this is that I recommend Firefox on Linux rather than Google-Chrome.

I wrote a script called `browser_move_to_firefox.sh` where you can see all the configs that need to be changed when moving to a different browser.
