Cannot turn this behaviour off. Video plays from the start even though it clearly shows that the video is in mid viewing. Very annoying since I have to find the right position again.</li> <li>Items disappear from \u201cMy List\u201d with no heads up warning. Very annoying. This is sometimes because Netflix remove shows from the platform which is also annoying and what\u2019s more \u2013 they don\u2019t clearly state what is going to go away and when inside the app. I have to go online and find out for myself.</li> <li>Things disappear from the \u201cContinue watching as\u2026\u201d list with no heads up. Very annoying and forces me to maintain my own list of stuff I\u2019m in the middle of watching. Sometimes this happens because a show is going off the platform (again, no heads up) and sometimes for no apparent reason at all.</li> <li>The UI does not allow me to store more than one list. I need one for things I\u2019ve seen and for things I want to see as well as things I\u2019m in the middle of seeing (see above why Netflix support for studd you are in the middle of watching is terrible).</li> <li>The site doesn\u2019t provide an API for getting your data from Netflix. This may be a problem shared by a small minority of programming inclined users but it is important to me.</li> </ul> <p>These problems are endemic to Netflix in general not just to a certain Netflix app or it\u2019s website, so they cannot be solved at the application level. Netflix really needs to fix core issues to make progress on any of these issues.</p> <p>As a result of all this I decided to leave Netflix. Bye bye.</p>"},{"location":"2025/09/04/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-without-their-upgrade-tool/","title":"How to upgrade Ubuntu without their upgrade tool","text":""},{"location":"2025/09/04/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-without-their-upgrade-tool/#the-problem","title":"The problem","text":"<p>The heart of the problem is that sometimes when you try to upgrade ubuntu the upgrade fails.
