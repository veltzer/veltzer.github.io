  <!-- 
    This SVG creates a simple, modern "V" shape.
    - The <path> element draws the shape.
    - "M 10 10" moves the "pen" to the starting point (top-left).
    - "L 50 90" draws a line to the bottom-center point.
    - "L 90 10" draws a line to the top-right point.
    - The stroke is set to a dark color (#2D3748).
    - The stroke-width makes the line thick.
    - stroke-linecap and stroke-linejoin make the corners sharp and clean.
    - fill="none" ensures the inside of the V is transparent.
